  The HALT Telecommand does not support any keywords. The HALT Telecommand always prompts a HALT_STATE Telemetry Response to confirm the halt. The HALT Telecommand always causes motor master power off. Therefore, the HALT Telecommand prompts a REGISTER Telemetry Response including GM_MASTER_POWER and SM_MASTER_POWER to confirm CMG power discontinuity.
