  The POWER_STATE Telemetry Response is always sent in response to the SET_POWER Telemcommand and the GET_POWER Telemetry Request. The POWER_STATE Telemetry Response always includes the keywords included in the prompting message. If the POWER_STATE Telemetry Response is prompted by the GET_POWER Telemetry Request, and if the GET_POWER Telemetry Request has no attributes, then the POWER_STATE Telemetry Response includes ALL Power State data.
