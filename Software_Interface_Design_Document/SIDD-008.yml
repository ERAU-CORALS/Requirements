  Bluetooth Communication Protocol

  DARTS and the CORALS Testbed communicate using a Bluetooth Serial connection. This means that loss is possible, and data could be corrupted in transmission. To detect and prevent this, the CORALS Testbed and HDARS will use a restricted, keyword-based communication protocol to minimize error passthrough.
