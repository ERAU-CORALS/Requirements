  The SET_CONTROL Telecommand supports use of the CORALS Control Parameter keywords. It requires including of one or more loop rate keywords or all gain keywords to be valid (if a non-zero number of gain keywords are included, all gain keywords must be included regardless of loop rate keywords). The SET_CONTROL Telecommand always prompts a CONTROL_STATE Telemetry Response including the changed keywords.
