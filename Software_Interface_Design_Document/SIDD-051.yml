  The ATTITUDE Telemetry Response is sent in response to the GET_ATTITUDE Telemetry Response. The ATTITUDE Telmetry Response is sent automatically on a 5 second period. It always contains the Q1, Q2, and Q3 keywords. If the QUAT_FORMAT is currently 'Q0', then it also contains Q0. Otherwise, it also contains Q4.
