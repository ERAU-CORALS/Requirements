  Introduction

  The CORALS Software Interface Design document was developed by Team CORALS as a design standard and reference for the Software Communication Protocols used on the CORALS Testbed. It is meant to replace the need for requirements specifying the format and breadth of command/data transmission to and from the CORALS Testbed with the client, as the requirements were not derivable from the customer objectives; the customer did not stipulate a standard. This document will serve as a source of design truth for the CORALS Software Communication interfaces.
